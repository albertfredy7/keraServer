More specifically, he's tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. Even worse, there's been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (OscarÂ® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po's Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. Po must team up with the quick-witted thief Zhen in order to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon's claws.",

      "review_txt": "Dune: Part One, the first chapter of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious attempt to re-create Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 novel for a generation not scarred by David Lynch's misfire, became the reason for many shuttered individuals to venture back to movie theaters as the pandemic waned in October 2021. Although the film's box office receipts were tepid for a would-be blockbuster, its through-the-roof performance on Warner Brothers' streaming app, HBO Max (it became available for streaming simultaneously with its theatrical release), convinced the studio to greenlight Dune: Part Two. Now, nearly 2 1/2 years later, after a delay necessitated by Hollywood's dual strike (which made the cast unavailable to do publicity), Dune: Part Two has finally reached theaters. Worth the wait? Unquestionably.\n\nWhen the ink has dried on analyses of the year 2024 at the movies, Dune: Part Two will stand not only near the top when it comes to big screen spectacle but will be regarded as one of the best films to be released during the twelve-month period. And, although director Denis Villeneuve is already writing the screenplay for the third part of a projected Dune trilogy (this one based on Herbert's 1969 book, Dune Messiah), box office performance will dictate whether that gets made. The wide-open ending of Dune: Part Two argues in favor of additional motion picture installments but, if none are made, at least Part Two completes the definitive adaptation.\n\nThere hasn't been anything like this since Peter Jackson tackled The Lord of the Rings some 25 years ago. At the time, many fans feared the New Zealander had bitten off more than he could chew but his three-film, eight-hour version turned out to be one of the most amazing success stories in novel-to-movie transformations. Villeneuve's Dune deserves similar consideration. Unwilling to condense Dune into a single movie, the director spread out the story over more than five hours, allowing him to retain many complexities, side plots, and characters that might otherwise have been eliminated or marginalized. Even considering the amount of breathing room accorded the story by the manner of its adaptation, changes were still necessary to create a better cinematic experience. And the uninitiated may be baffled by a few things here and there.\n\nDune: Part Two, like its predecessor, does an excellent job of taking some of the most fantastical aspects of the novel and translating them to the screen in a way that seems organic to the story. When dealing with elements like prophesy, mysticism, and hallucinogenic visions, this is no small achievement. The great sandworms churning the desert seas of Arrakis, superbly realized by cutting-edge computer generated special effects, are far more readily accepted than some of these things, but Villaneuve makes them work.\n\nThe movie picks up where Part One left off with Duke Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), seeking refuge with the Fremen following the massacre of House Atreides by House Harkonnen. Accepted by one of the Fremen leaders, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul seeks to learn the ways of the desert people. In the process, he begins an affair with Chani (Zendaya), while seeking to distance himself from the growing sentiment that he is the Fremen's prophesied messiah. A war develops between the Fremen and the invading Harkonnens, led by the Baron (Stellan Skargard) and his nephews, Glossu Rababan (Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). At stake is control of the planet and its most valuable resource, called \"spice.\" When Harkonnen victory is in question, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) decides to become directly involved, traveling to Arrakis with his daughter, the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), and the leader of the Bene Gesserit, Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling).\n\nIn keeping with Herbert's intentions regarding Paul's character arc, Villaneuve doesn't shrink from allowing his protagonist to travel a darkly seductive road. In Part One, Paul was unquestionably the hero. Here, he begins a journey that will take him in a different direction. A battle for his heart is waged by Jessica, who seeks him to achieve the fulness of his powers, and Chani, who fears for his soul. It's not hard to believe that Paul became at least in part an inspiration for Anakin Skywalker - similarities are hard to miss. Indeed, it's apparent how many elements of Dune and Dune Messiah (which were published at the time when George Lucas was becoming interested in filmmaking) made their way into the first Star Wars trilogy and its mythology (eventually fleshed out in the prequels).\n\nThree major new characters enter the fray during the course of Part Two and Villaneuve gives them sufficient backstory and screen time that they don't feel like they have been awkwardly dropped into an already-developed narrative. They are Feyd-Rautha, the psychopath nephew of Baron Harkonnen (and his would-be heir), who gets an entire 20-minute segment of introduction (mostly shot in black-and-white). The Emperor, name-checked in Part One, appears in the flesh in Part Two alongside his daughter, Irulan. Additionally, Anya Taylor-Joy has a small role as Paul's sister, Alia, whom he briefly meets in a dream sequence.\n\nThe returning stable of actors - Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgard, and Charlotte Rampling - reprise their roles with conviction. The most impressive turn belongs to Chalamet, whose character faces numerous life-altering and personality-shifting changes. In a film where many of the important men and women represent archetypes, Paul is unique. Chalamet's performance emphasizes not only Paul's impetuousness and charisma but the growing tragedy that underlies the embrace of his destiny.\n\nAs a big-screen spectacle, Part Two exceeds Part One. The cinematography is grand and at times hauntingly beautiful. The battles are bigger, more raw, and more intense. The desert is a character in its own right. Hans Zimmer's percussive score thrums and thrills. Villaneuve makes a persuasive case for why movie theaters still exist post-pandemic. Although the storyline is strong enough to preserve Part Two as a viable streaming option, much of the experience will be lost outside of a venue with a giant screen and sound-system to match. The film was made for IMAX and, although it will play effectively in generic multiplex auditoriums, this is one instance when the adage of \"bigger means better\" is applicable. Dune: Part Two is a spectacle to behold with an underlying arc that makes it more satisfying than a 2 1/2-hour bite of eye candy.\n\nÂ© 2024 James Berardinelli",

More specifically, he's tapped to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace.That poses a couple of obvious problems. First, Po knows as much about spiritual leadership as he does about the paleo diet, and second, he needs to quickly find and train a new Dragon Warrior before he can assume his new lofty position. Even worse, there's been a recent sighting of a wicked, powerful sorceress, Chameleon (OscarÂ® winner Viola Davis), a tiny lizard who can shapeshift into any creature, large or small. And Chameleon has her greedy, beady little eyes on Po's Staff of Wisdom, which would give her the power to re-summon all the master villains whom Po has vanquished to the spirit realm. Po must team up with the quick-witted thief Zhen in order to protect the Valley of Peace from Chameleon's claws.",

      "review_txt": "Ten years ago, with much fanfare, the DC Extended Universe was born. Warner Brothers, riding the wave of success from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, decided that rather than stick with stand-alone titles featuring their best-loved superheroes, they would instead chase Marvel by building a \"shared universe.\" The resultant umbrella project was rushed and chaotic with few standout films and a lot of duds. Justice League, rather than being DC's answer to The Avengers, was a colossal misstep from which the DCEU never recovered. Now, with James Gunn preparing to reboot the entire DC canon, the task has fallen to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - never during production intended to be a final chapter - to close the book on the DCEU. Perhaps fittingly, this anticlimactic slog is what we have come to expect from DC movies - an overlong, visually cluttered experience that's more interested in special effects and audio engineering than storytelling. The Aquaman sequel feels like it was mostly constructed in post-production, with CGI working hand-in-hand with editing to fashion something borderline-coherent. No matter how much fan love there might be for Jason Momoa, it's not enough to save this production.\n\nThere are essentially three major threads fighting for screen time. The first, and most enjoyable, relates to the brotherly rivalry between Arthur Curry (Momoa), King of Atlantis, and his deposed younger sibling, former King Orm (Patrick Wilson). Circumstances force Arthur to break Orm out of prison and the two engage in a white-hot love/hate relationship worthy of a rom-com. (Momoa has about 10x more chemistry with Wilson than with Arthur's alleged love interest, Mera, played by either Amber Heard or her cardboard lookalike.) Then there's a revenge subplot, with Aquaman baddie Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) determined to wipe out Arthur's entire bloodline using the black magic powers of his newly acquired \"Black Trident.\" Finally, there's the weaponization of Climate Change - a plot contortion that recalls Superman IV's disastrous attempt to meld real-world geopolitical concerns with a comic book storyline.\n\nThe film's overcluttered CGI at least gives viewers pretty things to look at for two hours. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score sounds suitably epic with discordant beats preparing viewers for big battles and ugly confrontations. But none of this means much of anything considering how little tension even the most extreme confrontation generates. The movie is so predictable that it's possible to take a bathroom break in the middle of a major fight scene and have a more exciting time trying to get the automated soap dispenser working properly. I stepped out for two minutes and missed absolutely nothing. This is short attention span cinema at its most extreme.\n\nFollowing the success of Aquaman, Warner Brothers decided that the best approach was to reform the band. So, in addition to re-signing most of the actors, director James Wan was lured back. Rumor has it that early test screenings were disastrous. Amber Heard's involvement became divisive after her spousal abuse trial against Johnny Depp. The unclear future of the DCEU, which apparently resulted in both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck filming scenes as Bruce Wayne (neither of which was ultimately used), hung like the Sword of Damocles over the extensive reshoots. Like The Flash, the movie was deemed too expensive a property to jettison, so it was released into theaters with a wing and a prayer - not the best strategy for a nine-figure production.\n\nTo the extent that there's anything worthwhile to be found in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom beyond the pretty visuals, one need look no further than the lead actor. Momoa has an easy, unforced charisma that shines regardless of whether he's re-enacting a scene from Three Men and a Baby, fighting to stay awake during an Atlantean council meeting, or trying to keep us from dozing off as he goes on an endless search for Black Manta.\n\nAs far as the Climate Change element is concerned - this aspect of the plot is so badly mishandled that it will thrill deniers far and wide. Climate Change is placed on the same level of fantastical nonsense as Black Magic Tridents and wondrous underwater cities. I'm sure that screenwriters had the best of intentions when writing this into the story but the same can be said of Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal when they sat down at a typewriter in 1986. What did we get out of that? Nuclear Man.\n\nSo I raise my glass to the DCEU - a decade-long cinematic excursion that, done differently, might have left behind more than a few, widely-scattered good memories. Some want to blame the pandemic for its failure but this is more a case of deep structural instability exacerbated by egomaniacal personalities and inept planning. The first Aquaman may have been low-brow fun but the second is a chore from start to finish. Momoa, we are told, will be back with DC in a different role. Hopefully this time he'll have a screenplay worthy of his larger-than-life personality.\n\nÂ© 2023 James Berardinelli",

      "review_txt": "Even though it is rather obviously trading on a familiar and beloved brand, Wonka is nevertheless a fun and imaginative family film - certainly better than one might expect from a production crassly viewed by some as a \"cash grab.\" While the movie is set up as a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it owes as much to The Greatest Showman as it does to the earlier movie. The narrative manages the difficult task of resurrecting the blended sweetness and nastiness of the original confection. Although the story is original and Roald Dahl is credited only as the creator of the characters, the tone is reflective of his work. While Tim Burton leaned heavily into the dark weirdness of Dahl and Mel Stuart preferred to lighten the mood, Paul King skates a line in between the two.\n\n2023 hasn't been an especially good year for family entertainment. Most releases have either been too childish for adults to enjoy or too \"mature\" for younger kids to appreciate. Wonka is one of the few (and perhaps the only live action example) to find a happy medium. It's softer than the PG-13 Barbie and not as juvenile as the various cartoon movies that have dotted the landscape. Altogether, although far from a perfect motion picture, Wonka is better than one might expect because it pays homage to the Gene Wilder iteration while telling its own story.\n\nThe narrative transpires about 15-20 years prior to the events related in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (or, alternately, the 2005 Burton remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) in an anonymous European city. That's where a wet-behind-the-ears chocolatier, Willy Wonka (Timothee Chalamet), arrives to make his fortune by opening a shop at the Galeries Gourmet. Unfortunately, as good as Willy's wares are (and they are very good), they can't save him from those who would prey on his naivete, like the innkeeper Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), or the leaders of the city's Chocolate Syndicate, Mssrs. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Matthey Bayton).  \n\nWilly soon finds himself in a perilous position. Unable to pay for his room, he becomes an indentured servant to Mrs. Scrubbit, who forces him to slave away in a launderette. While there, he bonds with the other workers, including the grumpy Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), and befriends Mrs. Scrubbit's serving girl, Noodle (Calah Lane). He also notices a small orange man following him around; he will later learn that this is Lofty (Hugh Grant), an Oompa-Loompa. Willy is determined not to be defeated by his dire circumstances and hatches an improbable plan by which he will escape from Mrs. Scrubbit's clutches and achieve his dream despite the opposition from the syndicate and their bought-and-paid-for police chief (Keegan-Michael Key).\n\nWonka is sometimes funny, sometimes weird, and sometimes silly. The musical nature of the production requires quite a bit of singing. In addition to several new songs composed by Neil Hannon and Joby Talbot, some of which are catchy, the movie brings back a couple of classics from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: the Leslie Bricusse/Anthony Newley numbers \"Oompa-Loompa\" (with reworked lyrics) and \"Pure Imagination.\" Sadly, there was no room for \"The Candy Man.\" Generally speaking, the music in Wonka could be considered a high point...with one reservation. As energetic and charismatic as he might be as an actor, Chalamet is a horrible singer. His strident crooning of \"A World of Your Own\" makes the otherwise enjoyable tune into an exercise in endurance.\n\nChalamet's performances echoes that of Gene Wilder without aping him. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was an enigmatic presence, Chalamet's portrayal is uniformly appealing. He is surrounded by an impressive supporting cast that includes Olivia Colman, the gruff Jim Carter (best known as Mr. Carson in Downton Abbey), and Sally Hawkins (as Willy's mom and the inspiration for all his endeavors). Hugh Grant has been cut down to size and colored up (Grant, in typical fashion, indicates he hated playing the part). And Keegan-Michael Key gets to start the film looking somewhat normal before plumping up to resemble Mr. Creosote in one of the movie's best sight gags.\n\nThe set design is fantastical without being overbearing and, late in the proceedings, provide a direct link to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The humor varies from endearing to subversive. There are instances when one might wonder whether someone from Monty Python snuck in and wrote a few lines. Cash-grab or not, Wonka is a welcome parfait to top off the meatier entrees that the film industry offers at this time of year.\n\nÂ© 2023 James Berardinelli",
